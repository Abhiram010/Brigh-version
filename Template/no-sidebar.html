			<p>
				I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhiram-adapaka/">Abhiram.adapaka</a>. I am pursing  bachelor of technology in Computer science. When i was browsing online for courses I never best course for free or which is accessible for free to any one. So, I want build a platform where developers create content for upcoming developer and help and that platform also must be non-profit and developed by developers. 
				Expenses are not big task when all developers are working we can easily bear with funds.When i got this idea.I expressed my idea to parents and some of my friends they said it's good
				and advised to learn technologies to implement. Then i worked out and made this static website online using 
				html,css. Because we can't sit and spend lot's of time only on learning and just leaving great ambition as an idea. 
				So i used all resources and done my best to bring out this website. I got an only (.in) domain for 0.0081$ using an offer and, Hosting is one of biggest challenge in front of me.
				 I used all platforms to know free hosting but initially i placed brig version on netlify. But we must improve it and make it ultimate learning platform.
